I just built an mcp server for salesforce (https://github.com/tomnagengast/mcp-server-salesforce) and now want to build one for hex. Reference the current mcp docs (https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk), hex api docs (https://learn.hex.tech/docs/api/api-overview) and build and mcp server that I can run with npx from Claude Desktop then create a new github repo. Remember to commit often so that you can understand what's happened so far and roll back to any points that you might need to.
