# Development Chat Transcript


I just built an mcp server for salesforce (https://github.com/tomnagengast/mcp-server-salesforce) and now want to build one for hex. Reference the current mcp docs (https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk), hex api docs (https://learn.hex.tech/docs/api/api-overview) and build and mcp server that I can run with npx from Claude Desktop then create a new github repo. Remember to commit often so that you can understand what's happened so far and roll back to any points that you might need to.

Reference the Hex API documentation again and add any additional tools that might be useful to an analyst list that uses Hex.
